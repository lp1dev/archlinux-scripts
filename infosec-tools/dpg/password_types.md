## Types of Passwords

Understanding basic password types will help you devise a strong password management strategy for all of your accounts. In general and at a high-level, there are two basic types of passwords:

```bash
  1. Primary Passwords
  2. Secondary Passwords
```

Primary passwords are inputted physically into a device. For example, logging into the operating system of a laptop in front of you or a tablet you are holding. Primary passwords are not good candidates for password managers. You should commit them to memory, or [write them down](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/06/write_down_your.html) and store them in your wallet or purse, or carry a [password card](https://www.passwordcard.org/en) to manage them. 

Secondary passwords are logically or remotely inputted into a system. Entering a password into a bank's website or remotely logging into a system are a few examples. Secondary passwords are ideal candidates for password managers and can be used at your bank, social media sites, etc.

DPG is intended to generate and manage secondary passwords.
